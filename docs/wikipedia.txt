This is the documentation for the wikipedia side of the code.

Prerequisites for Category Tree Search:
- sklearn
- nltk
- search_tree_with_text.json (in the google drive)

Prerequisites for Category Tree Generator:
- mwparserfromhell
- category_files directory that contains a list of articles in that category from pywikibot
- files.json which contains a json file of wikipedia file names to file location
- the unzipped wikipedia files


You can use the CategorySearch.py file to search the wikipedia category tree with a TFIDF vectorizer. It takes a while to train the vectorizer so give it some time.

TODO:
-Map to specific pages
-Enable non-sklearn vectorizers
-Add lemmatization to the NLP pipeline.
